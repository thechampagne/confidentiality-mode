* Confidentiality mode

 This mode is written after several long train rides where I wanted to avoid people looking over my shoulder. I wasn't working on anything confidential but the thought of prying eyes made me feel uncomfortable. I mean, think of all the excellent ideas I may have jotted down that might have been stolen!

 This mode will randomise all text on the screen and only reveal the text in the line/sentence the cursor is on.

 Type away you crazy horses.

 Feedback and comments very much welcome.
